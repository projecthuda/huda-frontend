# Huda Svelte.js with SkeletonUI

This is the frontend for the huda project initialized using a SkeletonUI template. It uses TypeScript, prettier for code formatting and eslint for linting.
You must have Node.js installed to run this server.

## Developing

After installing dependencies with `npm install` (or `pnpm install` or `yarn`) start a development server:

```bash
npm run dev

# or start the server and open the app in a new browser tab
npm run dev -- --open
```

## SkeletonUI

The documentation for SkeletonUI, which utilizes tailwind utility classes and design system capabilities to easily and quickly create pleasing and responsive interfaces, can be found [here](https://www.skeleton.dev/docs/get-started)

## Building

To create a production version of your app:

```bash
npm run build
```

You can preview the production build with `npm run preview`.

> To deploy your app, you may need to install an [adapter](https://kit.svelte.dev/docs/adapters) for your target environment.
